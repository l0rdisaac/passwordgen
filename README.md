# description
Will have options for length and which character sets to use (lowercase, capital, number, special, any [char])
# usage
I run this using PowerShell 7.4.5 with the command "pwsh -c .\passwordgen.ps1"\
To run without having to press a number and/or "Enter", I made the pwdgen.bat file to let me run the default option, or pass my desired option with "pwdgen [int]" to select which length I want or "pwdgen num" to just run the passwordgenNUM.ps1.\
Example commands : \
pwdgen 0
pwdgen 3
pwdgen num
